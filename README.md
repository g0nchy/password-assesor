# password-assesor
This is a simple command-line password assessor program written in C. I did it while doing the CS50x (Harvard's Introduction to Computer Science from HarvardX). It evaluates the strength of a user-provided password based on various criteria such as length, the presence of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters.
